# Push-up Detection System ðŸ’ª

A real-time *push-up counter and form feedback system* built with [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google/mediapipe) and [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/).  
This project uses computer vision to detect push-ups via elbow angles and provides *count + feedback* with video saving support.

## âœ¨ Features
- âœ… Real-time push-up detection using webcam  
- âœ… Automatic push-up counting with *noise-free smoothing*  
- âœ… Form feedback (Top / Bottom / In Motion)  
- âœ… Fullscreen output window  
- âœ… Saves output video (output_pushups.avi)
